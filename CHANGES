2/24/93 (P64 Version 1.1)

BUG FIXES:

Predicted motion vectors were not reset properly on the group of
blocks.  The LastMBA was changed from 11,22 to 10,21.  Also previous
type was considered.  This is sufficient to make things compatible
with June 1989 draft.  (if #define VERSION_1.0 is set)

DOCUMENTATION:

The colorspace section was edited to include more precise matrices and
a description of CCIR-601 versus JFIF style YUV->RGB conversion.  Also
updated to reflect code changes in quantization.

Some printers (non-laserwriters) have been unable to cope with the
doc.ps files, specifically problems occurred in the postscript include
files.  For some reason, Apple laserwriters and ghostscript do not
seem to be afflicted by the above problem.  We have found a change in
the dvi2ps postscript header that seems to fix this problem for Sun
newsprint (and probably other) printers as well.  If this still is a
problem, the raw tex and .ps files are available in the file
P64DOCv1.1.tar.Z.  Caution: the special scaling command has different
relative scales for different dvi2ps, dvips programs - can be a factor
of 100 off depending on the version of the header file.

CODE:

For H.261 1992 Compatibility changes:

Changed marker.c, huffman.c, init.c lexer.l, p64.c, ctables.h to
reflect the following:

Structure Information Changes:

Old				New

Picture layer:
Type1 (13 bits)         	PType (6 bits)
ParityEnable (1 bit)    	None
Parity(8 bits)          	None
PictureSpareEnable(1 bit)	(1 bit)   < Repeatable
PictureSpare (16 bits)		(8 bits)  <

GOB layer:

Type2 (6 bits)         		None
Quant1                  	GQuant
GroupSpareEnable(1 bit) 	(1 bit)   < Repeatable
GroupSpare (16 bits)    	(8 bits)  <

Macroblock Layer:

Type3				MType
Quant2                  	MQuant


Quantization:

if MQUANT odd:
        QAC = AC/2MQUANT

if MQUANT even:
        QAC = (AC+1)/2MQUANT;   AC > 0
        QAC = (AC-1)/2MQUANT;  AC < 0

or, more simply if one wishes to ignore reconstruction rounding-to-odd
effects, just consider the ODD case (for some reasons, that does not
cause any loss at all, so it was used in the MPEG codec 1.0, but that
is changed back in MPEG codec 1.1).


INVERSE QUANTIZATION:

if MQUANT odd:
        AC = (2QAC +1)*MQUANT; QAC > 0
        AC = (2QAC -1)*MQUANT; QAC < 0

if MQUANT even:
        AC = (2QAC +1)*MQUANT -1;  QAC >0
        AC = (2QAC -1)*MQUANT +1;  QAC <0


(stat.c) The statistics now include mean-removed squared error. 

MRSNR calculated based on (E[X^2]-E[X]^2)/E[error^2]
SNR calculated based on E[X^2]/E[error^2].
PSNR calculated based on 255*255/E[error^2].

(p64.c) The default filename is now componentfile0.p64 rather than
componentfile0.P.  An intra mdu is forced every 132 frames under
default mode.

5/14/93

Changes to the p64.c to reflect better termination conditions.  It
checks for end of file for all files terminated with at the end of a
stream.

3/24/94

Changed the -z suffix option to add a break.

1/17/95 

Fixed bug in p64.c where the RCStore was not subtracting start frame
and was overflowing...
